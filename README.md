# BookStore Frontend

Welcome to the **BookStore Frontend**! This is the frontend implementation of the BookStore application, developed using React.js. The frontend interacts with the backend API to manage books, including features like listing books, adding books, and user authentication.

## Features

- Display a list of books fetched from the backend
- Add a new book with title and author
- Secure routes using JWT-based authentication
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for UI development
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **Redux** for State Management 
- **React Router DOM** for navigation
- ** Material UI and CSS** for styling
